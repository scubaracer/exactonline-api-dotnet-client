C# client SDK for the Exact Online RESTFul API
===============
Dare to contribute

At Exact we know how important it is to have an API you can easily work with. In reaching this ambition the next step is to offer you a C# client SDK which gives you a set of easy functions to call our API. Just some words for otherwise long statements. Combine it with the right Oauth framework and you are quickly on your way.

We have built this open-source client SDK so that you, as part of our community, can contribute to this C# SDK or just build a client SDK for the language you love. Check out the Github page and start contributing to make all our lives more focused.
